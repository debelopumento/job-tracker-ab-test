# A job tracker app I built for myself as I'm job hunting.

The coding bootcamp I graduated from asked graduated students that are looking for jobs to use a spreadsheet to keep track of our job search. As the spreadsheet gets longer, I think I'd like an app that helps me organize those records, and later it can be easier to sort or search for certain record.

I was also adviced to do thorough research on companies and jobs and to customize my cover letter and job applications. I would like to A/B test to see if customizing my applications gives me higher returns on the time I spend than spam-apply to jobs without reading job descriptions.

This is a job tracker app I built for myself as I'm job hunting.

While I read/learnt about job hunting, I was adviced to do thorough research on companies and jobs and to customize my cover letters and job applications. I would like to A/B test to see if customizing my applications gives me higher returns on the time I spend than spam-apply to jobs without reading job descriptions. After all, I would like to get higher return rate on the time I invest.

This super simple app logs the time I spend on spam applications and cutomized applications. It also logs phone screens I got from both applications. And it will show me the comparison of both records and return rates.
